    "description": "The BrainTree connector allows you to access the BrainTree Java SDK API through the WSO2 ESB. BrainTree is a full-stack payments platform that makes it easy to accept payments online. BrainTree is available in US, Europe, Australia as well as Canada, and merchants can accept payments in 130+ currencies. BrainTree replaces the traditional model of sourcing a payment gateway and a merchant account from different providers, and the Venmo Touch feature enables one touch payments to reduce checkout friction.
